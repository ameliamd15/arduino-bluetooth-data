# arduino-bluetooth-data

iOS app to connect to an Arduino Nano BLE sense over bluetooth and extract accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer in real time. Code has been through many iterations but is still very buggy. Most of the code to connect to a bluetooth device has been copied from a proprietary device connector. I basically added a new peripheral to talk to arduino. Crashes a lot, so use at your own risk.
